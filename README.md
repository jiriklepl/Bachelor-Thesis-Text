# A slightly improved thesis template

What's new:

- modern packages (biblatex, cleveref, better fonts)
- less confusing directory structure
- slightly more useful examples (figures, diagrams, tables, code listings), structure hints, some goodies
- autobuilding of abstract PDF/A from metadata
- university-wide variants of the front page (nature faculty&bioinformatics!)
- Czech localization with nicely named references

See the [pre-built version](build/thesis.pdf) for details

## How-to

1. Type `make`, check that everything compiles. You should get a `thesis.pdf` that passes the PDF/A validation. If not, complain.
2. Fill in `metadata.tex` and all `xmpdata` files.
3. Look at the example code (there are several hints), remember it, erase it.
4. Write the thesis.
5. Submit and defend the thesis.

## PDF/A

With a bit of luck, you should get PDF/A right out of LaTeX.

A working PDF/A validator that can point out exact problems is here: https://github.com/mff-cuni-cz/cuni-thesis-validator

Common PDF/A problems include:

- imported PDF pictures that are not PDF/A.
- the used font does not support PDF/A (including the fonts in imported pictures). See https://martin.hoppenheit.info/blog/2018/pdfa-validation-and-inconsistent-glyph-width-information/ for a very ugly case.

Solutions:

- use `pdfa.sh` to convert PDFs to PDF/A-compatible form the "hard way" (although this does _not_ retain the PDF/A metadata mark, see comments in the script).
- read the commentary by Martin Mare코 (that describes most of the common problems) here: https://mj.ucw.cz/vyuka/bc/pdfaq.html
- use `pdfa.sh` as a last resort for `thesis.pdf` if everything other fails
